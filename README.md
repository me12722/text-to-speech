# text-to-speech

For version 1.0 of this app the user is provided with a 2 fields, File Name and Text. The fields get posted to the backend where an MP3 file is created and then the user gets a download of the MP3. No efforts at optimization have been made yet, this was merely a proof of concept though large blocks of text are still returned without too much delay. 

For verison 1.1 I will get rid of the unused template. I will also add a spellcheck layer and a choice of different voices.
